# Simple Ocean Examples

This repository provides examples of introductory Ocean programs and concepts.  Many of the problems that these examples are created from in this repository are explored in our guide, ["Learning to Formulate Problems"](https://docs.dwavesys.com/docs/latest/c_pf_3.html#social-networks-friends-and-enemies).  This guide discusses how to formulate problems as a binary quadratic model, or BQM, as required by the Ocean SDK.

## Basic Programs

In the `Basic_Programs` folder are programs to demonstrate the basic usage of the Ocean SDK to run QUBO and Ising problems on the D-Wave quantum processing unit (QPU).

## BQM Functionality

In the `BQM_Functionality` folder are programs that demonstrate the functionality of the binary quadratic model (BQM) structure within Ocean.  Using BQMs we can translate seamlessly between QUBO and Ising models, and provide offsets for any constants in our models.
