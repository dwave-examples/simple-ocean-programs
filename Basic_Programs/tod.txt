Hi,

I just submitted an application for the Data Science and System Security Researcher position at NEC-Labs Princeton, and I would like to add a further professional referee (from NEC-Labs) to my application:

Puzzling institutional behavior
Uic saying I should go thro the competitive process again for next year, and gmu is refusing contact of any sort.

Hi Cameron,

I was just going to check if there had been any further news on the office/collaboration with Duke?

It would be great to put a meeting on the calendar to catch up some time over the break.  I'll be in New Haven most of the time, and I should be free most days next week if you had time to call then, otherwise we can always leave it until after the new year.

Just let me know, and it would be good to catch up soon,

Best,

Jonathan


It seems that you've been personally upset by something I've done, which I'm having a hard time understanding.  In any case, I've resubmitted my application for this year's search for what it's worth.

I remain open to discussing the situation to try to clarify what the underlying issues are/were.

Dear Sahar,

I apologize for the delay in resubmitting the revisions for our manuscript PATTERNS-D-21-00152.  There were a large number of reviews (6 reviews), so it has taken us a while to work out the best way of revising the manuscript to meet the overlapping concerns of all of the reviewers.

If possible therefore, we'd still like to extend the resubmission to 02/28/22, but may be able to submit the revisions earlier, e.g. 02/15/22 if this would be preferable.

Best wishes,

Jonathan
