# Pegasus Embedding Video Programs

These are the resource files used to create the [Pegasus embedding video](https://youtu.be/aAhvyxzJyQE).

The file `pegasus_graph.py` constructs a P16 and a P6 graph.  The files 
`embed_draw_clique.py`, `embed_draw_random.py` and `embed_draw_sparse.py`
are snippets which construct and embed graphs, and have rudimentary 
plotting calls.  The file `double_plot.py` is used to create the actual 
images used in the video.
